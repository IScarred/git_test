This is my first time using github.com and git since I started learning to program. I have to admit I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed.
There is so much to learn and do in order to become a programming engineer. I took the quick and safe way to a career over 20 years ago.
I have to commit myself into a career I should have ventured into over 20 years ago. This won't be easy but, my current career wasn't either.
